# "Guessing Game"
is a game with two parties: the "chooser" and the "guesser":

The "chooser" picks a natural number larger than zero, and when given a guess, will return # whether if the real answer is higher or lower.
The "guesser" must guess what the number is by repeatedly making guesses to the "chooser"
until the correct answer is found. This is the class that I implemented in Guesser.java.
