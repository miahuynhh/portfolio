# portfolio

This is Mia Huynh's portfolio.
It includes my creative projects and the projects I have completed for UW's CS classes.
The scope of the projects span both front-end to back-end.

Most of my projects were developed in Visual Studio Code, intelliJ IDEA, and Android Studio, using the following languages: Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Kotlin.
