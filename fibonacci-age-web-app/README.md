** Is your Age a Fibonacci Number? **

A simple web application that lets a user input their name and age. If their name is a Fibonacci number, shows a message saying so. If their name isnâ€™t yet a Fibonacci number, shows a message saying in how many years their age will be a Fibonacci number.

To install the required libraries, run the command npm install --no-audit in the fibonacci-age-web-app directory.

The web app can be run by running the command npm run start, then pointing the browser at http://localhost:8080/ .

The source files include functions to recursively generate a Fibonacci number with speed, defensive checks on user input and tests for the application, as well as front-end components.
